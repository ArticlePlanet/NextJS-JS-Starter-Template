This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To reinstall the `node_modules` folder in a Next.js app, you can follow these steps:

1. **Delete `node_modules` folder**: First, you need to delete the existing `node_modules` folder. You can do this by navigating to your project directory in the terminal and running:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```
or, on Windows:
```bash
rmdir /s node_modules
```

2. **Delete `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`**: Depending on whether you're using npm or Yarn, delete the respective lock file. You can do this by running:

```bash
rm -rf package-lock.json
```
or
```bash
rm -rf yarn.lock
```

3. **Install dependencies**: After deleting `node_modules` and the lock file, you can reinstall the dependencies by running either:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

This will reinstall all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file and generate a new `node_modules` folder.

4. **Run the Next.js app**: Once the installation process completes without any errors, you can run your Next.js app again using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

Your Next.js app should now be running with the newly installed dependencies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
